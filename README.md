        <p>Greetings! I'm Bobby.</p>

        <p>Over the past year, I have delved into the realm of data science, focusing on big data engineering, data architecture, and data visualization.</p>

        <p>Now, in my final year of graduate studies, I am eagerly seeking full and part-time opportunities to put my classroom knowledge into action and further hone my programming skills using the latest methodologies.</p>
