# About Me

👋 Greetings! I'm Bobby.

Over the past year, I have delved into the realm of data science, focusing on...

🛠 Big data engineering &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🏛 Data architecture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📈 Data visualization

Now, in my final year of graduate studies, I am eagerly seeking full and part-time opportunities to put my classroom knowledge into action and further hone my programming skills using the latest methodologies.
