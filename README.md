Greetings! I'm Bobby.

Over the past year, I have delved into the realm of data science, focusing on big data engineering, data architecture, and data visualization.

Now, in my final year of graduate studies, I am eagerly seeking full and part-time opportunities to put my classroom knowledge into action and further hone my programming skills using the latest methodologies.
