# 👋 Greetings! I'm Bobby

Over the past year, I have delved into the realm of data science, focusing on...

🛠 Big data engineering &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🏛 Data architecture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📈 Data visualization

Having recently graduated with a master's degree in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago, I am eagerly seeking full-time opportunities to put my classroom knowledge into action and further hone my programming skills using the latest methodologies.
